# 540 Frontend Challenge

## Problem definition

SeQura provides the shopper users an aplication where they can see the products they have bought and the instalments they have to pay. The app also allows the shopper to see the details of the product order.

As part of our product iteration process, the Product Designer from the team has made a wireframe and now is asking you to implement an application to display one screen with order list and another with the order details. The Product Designer is also very interested in analysing any shopper interaction with the app so the team can improve it in future iterations.

We expect you to:

1. Create the prototype for the wireframe that the Product Designer has given you a Figma.
2. Integrate the prototype with seQura mock API to fetch orders.
3. Prepare the prototye for an eventual integration for analytics service.
4. Create the animation between the order list and the order detail screen.
5. Create the pay button in the order detail screen that will call the seQura mock API to pay the order.

### Things to take into account

- Create a README explaining:
  - Detailed information about how to use the application. Assume a new member is joining the project and don't know anything about it.
  - An explanation of your technical choices, tradeoffs, assumptions you took, etc.
  - If you left things aside due to time constraints, explain why and how you would resolve or improve them.
- You should consider this code ready for production as it was a PR to be reviewed by a colleague. Also, commit as if it were a real-world feature.
- Design, test, develop and document the code. It should be a performant, clean, and well-structured solution.
- We care a lot about testing, so pay special attention to your app tests.
- You shouldn't spend more than 5h on the challenge.
- Since it's frontend challenge, we expect the code based in JavaScript or Typescript.
- As it is a React Native position we expect to use react-native CLI or Expo.
- We expect the demo to work minimum on iOS 17 and Android 14.
- Your experience level will be taken into consideration when evaluating.
